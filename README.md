Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction
Project Overview
This project involves building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used for this analysis.

Project Objectives
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to make it suitable for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and gain insights.
Model Building: Develop a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchases.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the classifier using appropriate metrics.
Visualization: Visualize the results and key findings.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information about customer demographics and behaviors, which are crucial for predicting purchase decisions.

Train the model on the training dataset.
Predict outcomes on the testing dataset.
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the classifier's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize the decision tree and analyze its structure.
5. Visualization
Create plots to visualize the results and key findings.
Present the insights in an easy-to-understand format.
Results and Insights
The decision tree classifier was able to predict customer purchases with a certain level of accuracy.
Key features influencing the purchase decision were identified.
The model's performance was evaluated, and the results were visualized for better understanding.
Conclusion
