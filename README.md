# Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

## Project Overview

This project involves building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used for this analysis.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to make it suitable for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and gain insights.
3. **Model Building**: Develop a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchases.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the classifier using appropriate metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information about customer demographics and behaviors, which are crucial for predicting purchase decisions.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building the decision tree classifier.


## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Load the dataset.
- Handle missing values and clean the data.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyze the distribution of features.
- Identify correlations between variables.
- Visualize key insights using plots and charts.

### 3. Model Building

- Develop a decision tree classifier using Scikit-learn.
- Train the model on the training dataset.
- Predict outcomes on the testing dataset.

### 4. Model Evaluation

- Evaluate the classifier's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize the decision tree and analyze its structure.


## Results and Insights

- The decision tree classifier was able to predict customer purchases with a certain level of accuracy.
- Key features influencing the purchase decision were identified.


## Conclusion

This project provided valuable experience in building and evaluating a decision tree classifier for customer purchase prediction. It enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and  machine learning.
